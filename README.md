# Developing a Neural Network Classification Model

## AIM

To develop a neural network classification model for the given dataset.

## Problem Statement

An automobile company has plans to enter new markets with their existing products. After intensive market research, they’ve decided that the behavior of the new market is similar to their existing market.

In their existing market, the sales team has classified all customers into 4 segments (A, B, C, D ). Then, they performed segmented outreach and communication for a different segment of customers. This strategy has work exceptionally well for them. They plan to use the same strategy for the new markets.

You are required to help the manager to predict the right group of the new customers.

## Neural Network Model

Include the neural network model diagram.

## DESIGN STEPS

### STEP 1:
Import the required packages

### STEP 2:
Import the dataset to manipulate on
### STEP 3:
Clean the dataset and split to training and testing data
###STEP 4:
Create the Model and pass appropriate layer values according the input and output data

###STEP 5:
Compile and fit the model

###STEP 6:
Load the dataset into the model

###STEP 7:
Test the model by predicting and output

              'Graduated','Profession',
              'Spending_Score']] = enc.fit_transform(customers_1[['Gender',

```



Encoding of output values
```
le = LabelEncoder()
customers_1['Segmentation'] = le.fit_transform(customers_1['Segmentation'])
customers_1 = customers_1.drop('ID',axis=1)
customers_1 = customers_1.drop('Var_1',axis=1)
customers_1['Segmentation'].unique()
X=customers_1[['Gender','Ever_Married','Age','Graduated','Profession','Work_Experience','Spending_Score','Family_Size']].values
y1 = customers_1[['Segmentation']].values
one_hot_enc = OneHotEncoder()
one_hot_enc.fit(y1)
y = one_hot_enc.transform(y1).toarray()
```
Spliting the data
```
X_train,X_test,y_train,y_test=train_test_split(X,y,
                                               test_size=0.33,

Creation of model

ai_brain = Sequential([
  Dense(units = 8, input_shape=[8]),
  Dense(units =16, activation='relu'),

metrics.head()
metrics[['accuracy','val_accuracy']].plot()
metrics[['loss','val_loss']].plot()

x_test_predictions.shape
y_test_truevalue = np.argmax(y_test,axis=1)
y_test_truevalue.shape
print(confusion_matrix(y_test_truevalue,x_test_predictions))
print(classification_report(y_test_truevalue,x_test_predictions)
